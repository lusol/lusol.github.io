                    <p class="aboutmeP" id="aboutMeP2"> I am an 18 year old computer programmer studying computer science at the University of Waterloo in                                Ontario, Canada. I am most proficient in programming in <b>Scheme</b> but I also have experience programming
                        in <b>HTML</b>, <b>Javascript</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b> C </b> and <b>C++</b>. In the upcoming term, I will be learning how to code in <b>Python</b>.

                    <p id="lifestory">I've always been fascinated with computers for as long as I can remember, interested in how letters popped up on the                            screen and how pictures moved from side to side. I started to truly become immersed in the world of computer science in                                          grade 10 when I took my first introductory programming course. Having my first "Hello World" pop onto the screen was exhilerating.                              Being                           constantly surrounded by gifted coders in high
                     school as well as having 2 parents both working in the tech-industry spurred my passion to even greater lengths. When grade 12 arrived,
                     university applications were of prime importance and I automatically knew which one I wanted to attend: University of Waterloo. With                            their
                     outstanding track-record in helping their students find employment, I knew that I wanted to partake in their culture of perfection and 
                     excellence. My first term at waterloo entailed a list of harsh life lessons as well as pleasant surprises. The greatest asset Waterloo                          was able provide however, was oppurtunity. Oppurtunity to talk to like-minded people, oppurtunity to learn from the brightest compsci                            proffessors and oppurtunity to join the most prestigious companies. The second term is coming up which means student will be bustling                            to prepare for potential co-op interviews. I'm quite excited about the co-op process, but also nervous because of the interviews that                            are involved. Hopefully, I will be blessed with a job where I can further educate myself.
