                    <p id="lifestory">I've always been fascinated with computers for as long as I can remember, interested in how letters popped up on the                                                               screen and how pictures moved from side to side. I started to truly become immersed in the world of computer science in                                                           grade 10 when I took my first introductory programming course. Having my first "Hello World" pop onto the screen was exhilerating.                                                 Being constantly surrounded by gifted coders in high school as well as having 2 parents both working in the tech-industry spurred my passion                                       to even greater lengths. When grade 12 arrived, university applications were of prime importance and I automatically knew which one I wanted                                       to attend: University of Waterloo. With their outstanding track-record in helping their students find employment, I knew that I wanted to                                         partake in their culture of perfection and excellence. My first term at waterloo entailed a list of harsh life lessons as well as pleasant                                         surprises. The greatest asset Waterloo was able provide however, was oppurtunity. Oppurtunity to talk to like-minded people, oppurtunity to                                       learn from the brightest compsci proffessors and oppurtunity to join the most prestigious companies. The second term is coming up which                                           means student will be bustling to prepare for potential co-op interviews. I'm quite excited about the co-op process, but also nervous                                             because of the interviews that are involved. Hopefully, I will be blessed with a job where I can further educate myself.

                        Aside from this website, I will be creating a couple of other side projects and hosting them on this website. These projects are meant to help me practice                         my programming skills while creating things I enjoy. The list might be small right now, but I promise I'll make it grow! In the mean time, take a look at                         my small math projects.
